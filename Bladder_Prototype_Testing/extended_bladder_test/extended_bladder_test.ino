/*
	This program is designed to monitor four (4) bladders for constant pressure.
	Four bladders will be attached to four pressure sensors and teh pressure sensors attached to 4 analong pins on the Arduino.
	Then all four bladders will be filled to the same pressure.
	The bladders will then be left alone, the Arduino will monitor their pressure.

	The purpose of this test is to see if any of the bladders can hold pressurized air for an extended period of time.
	The bladders are expected to remain filled for an extended time on the order of minutes, hours, or even longer.
	Monitoring the bladders with the Arduino makes this task more convenient and accurate.

// this function uses millis()
// millis uses a 32 bit unsigned long, therefore it counts up to 4294967296 milliseoncds or 1193.05 hours

// INPUT -> none
// OUTPUT -> (float) hours

  // multiply that number by 2.77778e-7, the number of hours in 1 millisecond
  // return the calculated number of hours
